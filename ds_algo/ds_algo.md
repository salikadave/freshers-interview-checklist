## Data Structures

* Write a code to remove duplicate integers in a singly linked list when:
  * when duplicates are consecutive
  * when they're arranged randomly
* List data structures you are familiar with + explain use cases
* Define dequeue
* Difference between stack and queue
* Difference between them: Array vs ArrayList, Stack and Queue
* Design a Stack using Queue and vice versa
* How can you count the number of unique words on your resume / any textual document?
* Explain Stack, Queue, Arrays \(any data structure\) with a real-life example.
* Is there any difference between a hashmap and a hashset?
* Implement a Queue using two Stacks

## Algorithms

* Calculate time & space complexity for a given problem / code.
* Difference between DFS and BFS
* Difference between binary search and binary search tree
* Difference between vectors and arraylist
* Explain divide and conquer algorithms
* Demonstrate any of the sorting / searching algorithms
* Explain merge sort to a non-technical person
* Write code for binary search.
* What is the time complexity of bubble sort?
* Performing level order traversal in a tree
* How can you find a common node of two linked lists?
* How will you search through 2 connected linked lists \(sizes m, n\) in less than O\(m\*n\)?
* Find the closest element to the given value from a sorted array \(includes negative numbers as well\) in less than O\(n\)?
* How will you print the left representation of a binary tree \(not a binary search tree\)?
* Demonstrate your understanding about merge sort.
* Given a problem, perform binary search tree operations.
* What do you mean by algorithms? Do not give me the literal definition. Impress me. `Creativity level MAX üí™üèª`
