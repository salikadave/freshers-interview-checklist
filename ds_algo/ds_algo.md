## Data Structures

- Write a code to remove duplicate integers in a singly linked list when:
  -  when duplicates are consecutive
  -  when they're arranged randomly
- List data structures you are familiar with + explain use cases
- Define dequeue
- Difference between stack and queue
- Difference between them: Array vs ArrayList, Stack and Queue, 

## Algorithms

- Calculate time & space complexity for a given problem / code.
- Difference between DFS and BFS
- Difference between binary search and binary search tree
- Difference between vectors and arraylist 
- Explain divide and conquer algorithms
- Demonstrate any of the sorting / searching algorithms
- Explain merge sort to a non-technical person
- Write code for binary search.
- What is the time complexity of bubble sort?
- Performing level order traversal in a tree
- How can you find a common node of two linked lists?
- How will you search through 2 connected linked lists (sizes m, n) in less than O(m*n)?
- Find the closest element to the given value from a sorted array (includes negative numbers as well) in less than O(n)?
- How will you print the left representation of a binary tree (not a binary search tree)?
