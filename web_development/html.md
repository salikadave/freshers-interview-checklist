# HTML

* Which are the new tags in HTML5 ?
* Write code for a basic HTML form to take an input name. Consequently add a regex to check for valid names.

  \(The type of input is just an example here, try practicing code with different kind of inputs and possible regex patterns\)

* List tags you are aware of and explain them.
* Explain the DOM Tree, NodeLists & Collections
* What do you understand by webpage metadata? OR What goes in the `<head>` tag?
* Design a webpage for booking bus tickets.
