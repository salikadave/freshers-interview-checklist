## Technical Problems

- Given a 2d array sorted each row and each rowâ€™s first element sorted, find the location of an element.
- Also, optimize the solution.
- Write code to print Fibonacci series.
- Write code to arrange white balls together then red balls when randomly arranged red and white balls are given.
- You have 8 balls, 1 of which is heavy, and you have a weighing balance, find the heavier ball in minimum number of iterations.
- Alice and Beth run the 100 meters race. Alice wins by 10 meters. In the next race, Alice starts 10 meters behind Beth, who will win if their speeds are the same as before?
- Write a program to print prime numbers
- Write a code in order to reserve the characters in an array/string.
- Problems on string concatenation
- Find the middle element of an array without using length.
- Water-Island Problem: Given a 2D Boolean matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s (an isolated 1 is also considered a group) forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands
```
Input : mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
                   {1, 1, 0, 0, 1},
                   {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
                   {1, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                   {1, 0, 1, 1, 1} 
Output : 3
